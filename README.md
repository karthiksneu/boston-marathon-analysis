# Boston Marathon Analysis

Welcome to the Boston Marathon Analysis repository! This project analyzes historical data from the Boston Marathon, providing insights and visualizations on various aspects of the race.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the Boston Marathon dataset, which includes detailed information about runners, their times, and race conditions over the years.

## Analysis Overview

The repository includes the following analysis components:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Scripts and notebooks to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizations and statistical summaries to explore trends and patterns in the data.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Hypothesis testing and statistical modeling to derive meaningful conclusions.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Interactive dashboards and plots to present insights from the analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and scripting.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive development environment for Python data analysis.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Libraries for data manipulation, numerical computing, and visualization.

## Getting Started

To explore the analysis and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.6 or higher) installed on your machine.
- Jupyter Notebook installed (`pip install notebook`).

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karthiksneu/boston-marathon-analysis.git
   cd boston-marathon-analysis
   ```

2. **Setup Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Jupyter Notebooks:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   - Open and run the notebooks (`*.ipynb`) to interact with the analysis scripts and visualizations.

5. **Explore the Analysis:**

   - Navigate through each notebook (`*.ipynb`) to view different aspects of the Boston Marathon analysis.
   - Execute cells to see results, modify code, or add your analyses.

## Directory Structure

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, EDA, and visualization.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data preprocessing and statistical analysis.
